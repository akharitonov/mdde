# Integration with the learners

MDDE Is not designed with one particular reinforcement learning framework in mind.

You must provide the interfacing class that make MDDE compatible with the reinforcement learning framework of your choosing by extending the `mdde.integration` namespace by providing a namespace package \([PEP 420](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/)\).
